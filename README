Amiga drivers for K1208 board SPI peripherals

(C) 2018 Mike Stirling

Compile on Linux with the gcc-2.95 toolchain from 
git://github.com/cahirwpz/amigaos-cross-toolchain.git

With the toolchain in the path both drivers can be compiled just by
typing "make".  The binaries can be found at:

sd/build-device/spisd.device and
net/build-device/spinet.device

Both of these files should be placed on the Amiga in DEVS:

An example mountfile can be found in the "amiga" directory.  This
should be placed in DEVS:DOSDrivers for auto-mount on boot, or
in SYS:Storage/DOSDrivers for on-demand mounting.

The ethernet driver is SANA2 compliant and has been tested with
Miami.  Configure as a standard SANA2 ethernet device.
